Matrix based approach for simulating complex emotions and subconscious in to AI.

## Emotion Matrix Representation from User Input
This repository provides an approach for converting user input in text format into a matrix representation that captures key emotional factors. This matrix representation serves as a foundation for emotion manipulation and blending using defined mathematical operations.

## Approach Overview

1. Matrix Dimensions: The dimensions of the matrix representation are determined based on the specific emotional factors to be captured. For instance, a 2x1 matrix may be chosen to represent intensity and valence.
2. Text Preprocessing: The user input in text format is preprocessed to extract relevant information. Techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization are applied to normalize the text.
3. Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text to align with the matrix dimensions. These features capture the emotional factors to be represented, such as intensity and valence scores obtained through sentiment analysis techniques.
4. Matrix Construction: The matrix representation is constructed using the extracted features. The values are assigned to the corresponding positions in the matrix structure, representing the emotional factors.
5. Normalization: The matrix values are normalized if required, ensuring they fall within a specific range or are appropriately scaled for subsequent operations.
6. Integration with AI Model: The matrix representation is integrated into an AI model architecture for further processing. The matrix is passed as input to the model, allowing for emotion manipulation or blending using the defined mathematical operations.
